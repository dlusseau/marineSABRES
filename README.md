Hello and welcome to marineSABRES WP5 Task 5.3 code sharing platform!

The **/wapping4WP6** folder contains the functions developed in WP5 to be used in WP6 to place in the backend of the DSS.

-   *utils.R* contains all functionality required for the analyses

-   *Demo.R* contains a demo for Macaronesia with description of function input

The **/FCM matrix** projections folder includes the analyses and output from the PESTLE analyses.

The **/R** folder contains code for the qualitative (boolean) and semi-quantitative analyses of SES graphs.

-   *R code walkthrough of pipeline with ..r* contains a rough version of the SES analysis pipeline

-   *loop_analysis.r* goes through loop analysis of signed SES in R

-   *boolean.r* goes through stability analyses for boolean network

Currently Boolean approaches are used as an entry point to understand a freshly produced SES and then move to semi-quantitative (loop analysis) for a subset of possible states as well as quantitative simulations (matrix projection) to answer more precise questions.
